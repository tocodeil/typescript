# TypeScript Benefits for JS Devs

[x] TypeScript focuses on the Type System

[X] Find bugs before they happen
  - Use function `twice` from external file without import
  - Pass wrong type to `twice`
  - Use `querySelector` instead of `querySelectorAll`

[x] Refactor
  - Rename symbol
  - Use "show call hierarchy"

[x] Auto complete
  - Use "addEventListener" on different types of nodes to see different events
