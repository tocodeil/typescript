# TypeScript Benefits for JS Devs

[ ] TypeScript focuses on the Type System

[ ] Find bugs before they happen
  - Use function `twice` from external file without import
  - Pass wrong type to `twice`
  - Use `querySelector` instead of `querySelectorAll`


[ ] Refactor
  - Rename symbol
  - Use "show call hierarchy"

[ ] Auto complete
  - Use "addEventListener" on different types of nodes to see different events
